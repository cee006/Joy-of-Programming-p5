# Joy-of-Programming-p5

This is a website to host a p5 project. My p5js editor for this repository [[https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/CGur40qtP](https://editor.p5js.org/cee006/sketches/W46nCV_9R)]. This program generates a video the balls bounce back and forth inside a pre-defined screen frame and is adapted from Professor Meng's original program. The changes I made to this were:
1. When a ball collides with the box or a wall and changes direction, it changes color
2. Changed the font of the text in the box to a font from google
3. Moved the box and text to the middle of the page

The program can be run through this link [https://cee006.github.io/Joy-of-Programming-p5/]
